This directory contains examples using System V IPC message queues 
and Unix pipes/fork system calls.  


ex-pipe.c	C program that shows pipes created.  A fork call is used
		by a parent process to create a child process.  The parent
		and child processes exchange 3 messages.

msg-server.c	C program that creates an IPC message queue, and then waits
		for a message from the msg-client program.  Once a message 
		has been received, it sends a message to the client program.
		Then, it "cleans up" the IPC message queue.  The msg-server 
		program must be started before the msg-client program since 
		the message queue must be created before the msg-client uses it.

msg-client.c	C program that uses a message queue created by a different
		program (the msg-server program).  It sends a message to the
		msg-server and waits for a message from it.
